# TODO

This file is a list of todos that do not belong to an issue, are to small to create an issue for and in general are not important to be fixed.
Items can be added in any branch, any feature you are working on.
If you encounter a small inconsistency or something small that is not the way it should, add it here.
These todos can then be fixed in a single branch/merge-request.

-   [ ] Specify all cargo packages explicitly in `Cargo.toml` instead of using globs.
