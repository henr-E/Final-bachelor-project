# Simulators

The communication with the simulation manager is documented here: [**Simulator Communication
**](./simulator-communication.md).

## Responsibilities

Each simulator is responsible for processing part of a frame (timestep) in a simulation.
Concretely, a simulator takes some components as input and alters some of these, returning them as output to the
simulation.

## Load flow analysis

The documentation for the load flow simulation can be found [here](./load-flow-analysis.md)

## Energy-supply-and-demand-simulator

The documentation for the energy supply and energy demand simulation can be
found [here](./energy-supply-and-demand-simulator.md)

## Weather simulator

The documentation for the weather simulation can be found [here](./weather-simulator.md)

## Time simulator

The documentation for the time simulation can be found [here](./time-simulator.md)
